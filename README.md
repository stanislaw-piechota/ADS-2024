# Algorithms and Data Structures
### Laboratories 2024

This repository contains project for ADS course provided by TUL (2nd semester).

To build *.cpp* and *.h* files bash script `run` is used instead of `makefile`

### Script `run` usage:
- to build (compiling & linking) use `./run <directory>` (it creates *.o* compilier binaries and one **main** executable file)
- to remove binaries use `./run <directory> clean`
- for help run `./run`
